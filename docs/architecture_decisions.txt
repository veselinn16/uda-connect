- The location consumer will be retrieving and saving data from postgresql database using REST architecture.

- The location producer services will be using gRPC api passing to kafka as it is much more stable for large volume data.

- The Connection and Person services can use the REST api as it is much more dynamic and flexible.

- Finally data will be consumed by connection, the person service and the location producer will be used by the frontend to get the data.
